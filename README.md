# About Me

I am Gehna Agarwal, a first-year undergraduate student pursuing Electronics and Communication Engineering.  
My primary interests lie in building projects that combine **electronics, programming, and innovation**. I enjoy solving problems through creative approaches, whether that means writing efficient code, designing simulations, or building working prototypes using microcontrollers and sensors.

## Projects
- Smart Cap for the Blind – Arduino Uno + ultrasonic sensors to assist visually impaired individuals with obstacle detection  
- Solar System Simulation – Developed using Python, Pygame, vectors, and Newton's gravitational law  
- ASCII Wordle – Terminal-based Wordle clone with MySQL integration for streak tracking  
- Mini Tesla Coil – Designed and constructed a working scaled-down Tesla coil  
- Interactive Solar System Model – Raspberry Pi powered tactile system that announces planet names and features when touched  

## Experience
- Member of the technical team in **Saksham**, a community service project focused on developing accessible technology for the visually impaired and underprivileged  
- Leader of my school’s tech club **Paradox**, where I taught coding, 3D development, and logical reasoning  
- Published research paper on a simulation I created, exploring its applications and design  
- Winner of **Techvizz Programming Competition** (first place)  

## Interests
- Embedded systems and hardware prototyping (Arduino, Raspberry Pi)  
- Physics-based simulations and visualisation models  
- Developing accessible technology for inclusive communities  
- Software development in Python, C++, and MySQL  

## Goals
I aim to continue exploring the intersection of hardware and software, focusing on projects that make a difference in people’s lives while improving my technical skills in embedded systems, programming, and circuit design. I am also interested in collaborating on projects that promote accessibility, innovation, and problem-solving in real-world contexts.
